Hi! I’m **Tahmid Al Muntasir**, a passionate learner and developer. This site serves as a hub for showcasing my projects, blogs, and more.

Driven by an innate love for problem-solving, I am eager to combine knowledge from various fields to create better, more efficient solutions.


Current Role and Interests
======
I am currently a student with a deep curiosity for learning across various fields, including programming, mechanical design, game development, languages, and more. My passion lies in exploring how different disciplines intersect, allowing me to approach problem-solving in innovative and interdisciplinary ways.

Some of the key areas I'm actively exploring include:
- **Programming** (Python, Java, C, JavaScript)
- **Mechatronics** (3D modeling, machine design, PLC, Simulation, Electronics)
- **Machine Learning and Data Science**
- **Graphics Design and Video Editing**
- **Writing** (Fiction, Non-fiction, Technical, Academic)
- **Research**
- **Language Learning** (German, Japanese, Arabic and English)

I’m eager to keep expanding my knowledge and apply what I learn to create impactful solutions across these domains.


Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
